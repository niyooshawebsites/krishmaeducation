                <h1>Guru Mantras for Speculators</h1>

                <p>1. Focus: Speculate in NIFTY, Bank Nifty and in not more than 5 leading stocks.</p>

                <p>2. During normal times every leading stock moves about 2 to 3 percent during the day, you should take a trade when the stock has moved about 75% in either direction</p>

                <p>3. If you are playing long then you must have some short positions in weaker stocks.</p>

                <p>4. NEVER EVER trade without stop loss and never ever do averaging for a loosing trade.<p>

                <p>5. If your trade starts going adverse then without waiting for the stop loss to trigger, keep booking small losses too.<p>

                <p>6. Don't Be Greedy: It is impossible to catch tops and bottoms. Stock prices keep going up and down. Don't be greedy. Keep booking small profits on at least half the position or exit the entire position with small profits. Don't try to squeeze the last penny. Leave some profit for the other person also who is taking over your position.<p>

                <p>7. Never let a profitable trade turn into a loosing trade. Use trailing stop loss or take opposite position in next month's Futures of the same stock.<p>
